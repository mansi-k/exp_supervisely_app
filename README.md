Things tried:
1. Conditional visibility of inputs
2. Created repeating input templates using loops
3. Created event handlers using loops
4. API calls or variable operations do not run on every interaction unlike streamlit, hence no need of session variables
5. Non-input variable states are preserved

Need to test:
1. Caching
2. Multipage app
3. Authentication using query params & secrets
